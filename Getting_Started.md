## Understanding Bounty Statuses

- **Open** - Funded, waiting for solution
- **Pending Payment** - PR merged, creator deciding allocation
- **Paid Out** - Payment executed
- **Expired** - Deadline passed

---

## Key Concepts

### Multiple Contributors Get Paid

Unlike traditional bounties, multiple developers can contribute and all get paid based on their contribution value.

**Example:**
- Alice: Core fix (70% = $70)
- Bob: Tests (30% = $30)

### Auto-Split Protection

If creator doesn't decide within 7 days, payment auto-splits equally among all merged PRs.

### Funds in Escrow

Bounty funds are locked on blockchain. Platform cannot spend them. Only creator's payment decision releases funds.

### Public Transactions

All transactions visible on BaseScan blockchain explorer.
